  <h1>Crafting Scents</h1>

  <p>
    At <strong>Purith</strong>, crafting a scent is not simply a process - it is a delicate art form, where emotion, nature, and creativity come together to create something truly timeless.
    Each fragrance begins with inspiration: a memory, a place, a feeling we want to share with the world.
  </p>

  <p>
    We begin by seeking out the finest natural ingredients, working closely with farmers, distillers, and artisans from every corner of the globe. 
    Every flower, resin, spice, and wood is chosen for its purity, character, and ability to tell a story. 
    Our perfumers, often referred to as "noses," treat these rare ingredients with deep respect, carefully balancing every note to create a scent that feels alive and unforgettable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Blending a perfume is an act of both science and poetry. 
    Each drop is measured with precision, yet every combination is tested, smelled, adjusted, and refined through a process that can take months - sometimes even years - to perfect. 
    Only when a composition stirs emotion and paints a picture in the mind, do we know it is ready.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our perfumes are built upon three layers: the top notes that create an instant impression, the heart notes that unfold slowly and define the character, and the base notes that linger on the skin, leaving a lasting memory.
    This careful layering creates a journey with every wear - a living story that evolves with you throughout the day.
  </p>

  <p>
    At Purith, we believe that scent has the power to transform a moment, capture a memory, and reveal your most authentic self.
    Every bottle we create is an invitation to discover your story, expressed through the invisible beauty of fragrance.
