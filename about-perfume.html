    <h1>About Our Perfume</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to the essence of our passion. At Purith, perfume is not just a fragrance — it’s an experience, 
      a story captured in a bottle. Every blend begins with a vision: a memory, a feeling, or a dream that 
      we seek to share with you. We meticulously source the world’s finest ingredients, from the lush fields 
      of Grasse to the exotic gardens of the East, to craft scents that are rich, pure, and timeless. 
      Each bottle is a labor of love, carefully created to evoke emotions and inspire confidence.
    </p>

      Whether you are drawn to fresh, sparkling notes that lift your spirit, or deep, seductive undertones 
      that leave a lasting impression, our collection offers a fragrance that feels uniquely yours. 
      Join us on a journey through scent and discover the invisible yet unforgettable signature 
      that defines your true self. Welcome to the world of Purith — where every scent tells your story.
